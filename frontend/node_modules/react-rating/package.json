  "readme": "[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-rating.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-rating)\n\n# React Rating\n\nReact Rating is a [react](https://github.com/facebook/react) rating component which supports custom symbols both with [inline styles](https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/inline-styles.html) and glyphicons found in popular CSS Toolkits like [Fontawesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) or [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/components/).\n\nThis React component was inspired by the jQuery plugin [bootstrap-rating](https://github.com/dreyescat/bootstrap-rating).\n\n## Demo\n\nSee [react-rating](http://dreyescat.github.io/react-rating/) in action.\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install `react-rating` component using the *npm* package manager:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save react-rating\n```\n\n### Dependencies\n\nThe `react-rating` component [peer depends](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#peerdependencies) on the [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) library.\n\nYou can install React using *npm* too:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save react\n```\n\n## Upgrade Warning\n\nIf you are using a version of React Rating < v1.0 be aware that **there are API changes between anything < v1.0 and v1.0 .** See the **Properties** and **Deprecated Properties and Callbacks** sections below for a documentation of the current API and how it compares to the old.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Require the Rating Component\n\n    ```javascript\n    var Rating = require('react-rating');\n    ```\n\n2. Start using it\n\n    With raw javascript:\n\n    ```javascript\n    React.createElement(Rating)\n    ```\n\n    Or with JSX:\n\n    ```jsx\n    <Rating />\n    ```\n\n## Properties\n\nProperty          | Type                                           | Default              | Description\n---               | ---                                            | ---                  | ---\n`start`           | *number*                                       | 0                    | Range starting value (exclusive).\n`stop`            | *number*                                       | 5                    | Range stop value (inclusive).\n`step`            | *number*                                       | 1                    | Describes how many values each Symbol represents. For example, for a `start` value of 0, a `stop` value of 10 and a `step` of 2, we will end up with 5 Symbols, with each Symbol representing value increments of 2.\n`fractions`       | *number*                                       | 1                    | Number of equal subdivisions that can be selected as a rating in each Symbol. For example, for a `fractions` value of 2, you will be able to select a rating with a precision of down to half a Symbol. Must be >= 1\n`initialRating`   | *number*                                   | 0                    | The value that will be used as an initial rating. This is the old `initialRate`.\n`placeholderRating`   | *number*                                   | 0                    | If you do not define an `initialRating` value, you can use a placeholder rating. Visually, this will have the same result as if you had defined an `initialRating` value. If `initialRating` is set `placeholderRating` is not taken into account. This is the old `placeholderRate`\n`readonly`        | *bool*                                         | false                | Whether the rating can be modified or not.\n`quiet`           | *bool*                                         | false                | Whether to animate rate hovering or not.\n`direction`       | *ltr* or *rtl*                                 | ltr                  | The direction of the rating element contents\n`emptySymbol`     | *element* or *object* or *string* or *array*   | Style.empty          | React element, inline style object, or classes applied to the rating symbols when empty. Can also be an array of such symbols that will be applied in a circular manner (round-robin). This is the old `empty`.\n`fullSymbol`      | *element* or *object* or *string* or *array*   | Style.full           | React element, inline style object, or classes applied to the rating symbols when full. Can also be an array of such symbols that will be applied in a circular manner (round-robin). This is the old `full`.\n`placeholderSymbol`      | *element* or *object* or *string* or *array*   | Style.placeholder           | React element, inline style object, or classes applied to the placeholder rating symbols. Can also be an array of such symbols that will be applied in a circular manner (round-robin). This is the old `placeholder`.\n\n## Callbacks\n\nCallback      | Type                           | Description\n---           | ---                            | ---\n`onChange`    | function (value) {}            | Gets called with the `value` when a different value than the currently set is selected.\n`onClick`     | function (value) {}            | Gets called with the `value` when a symbol is clicked. The value is equal to the value that corresponds to that part of the symbol.\n`onHover`     | function (value) {}            | Gets called with the `value` when you hover over a symbol. The value is equal to the value that corresponds to that part of the symbol. Gets called in `quiet` mode too. When hover ends, gets called with no `value` (i.e. `undefined` as the value).\n\n## Deprecated Properties and Callbacks\n\nThis is a list of deprecated properties and callbacks from versions older than v1.0\n\n* `onRate`\n* `initialRate`\n* `placeholderRate`\n* `empty`\n* `full`\n* `placeholder`\n\n## License\n\n[MIT License](https://github.com/dreyescat/react-rating/blob/master/LICENSE.md)\n",
